### Research Project: Document Retrieval System  
I built a document retrieval system using Llama-2-70B (Hugging Face API) and SentenceTransformers with ChromaDB for semantic search across 10,000+ documents. I engineered LangChain guardrails to reduce hallucinations by 70% and implemented a robust evaluation framework with confidence scoring and source attribution, achieving over 90% retrieval accuracy.

### InstaCart Product Recommendation Engine  
I created an interactive dashboard using Streamlit to analyze shopping patterns from the InstaCart dataset (3M+ orders). Leveraging K-means clustering with PCA for customer segmentation and FP-Growth for Market Basket Analysis, I achieved 85% confidence in product recommendations.

### Ollama API - [Github](https://github.com/AADARSH96/deepseek-lllama-ollama-api)
Developed a FastAPI-based RESTful API to interact with multiple large language models (LLMs), including DeepSeek and Llama2, using Ollama as the backend. This API allows users to send text prompts and dynamically select a model (e.g., deepseek-r1:1.5b or llama2) to generate tailored responses
